A web-based minimalistic calendar to create and organize events.

## API

Events can also be accessed and modified over API. There are two steps
to get access to events:

1. API access - The API consumer must be registered in CalX as a client.
2. User authorization access - The client must request user authorization
   which is ultimately granted by the corresponding user.
